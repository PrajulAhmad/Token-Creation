# Token-Creation
In this project I am creating my own token named as BREWIUM.

This Solidity program demonstrates function and mapping functionality of solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to mint and burn the token. 

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity used to mint and burn the BREWIUM token. This program serves as a simple and straightforward way to mint and burn the token with simple Solidity programming language syntax.

### Executing program

To run this program, we can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., TokenCreation.sol). Copy and paste the code into the file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile TokenCreation.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "TokenCreation" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it under Deployed/Unpinned Contracts section. Select the contract and click on tokenAbb, tokenName and totalSupply to see the token Abbrebiation, Name and Total supply of the token.

Under mint section paste the account address and give the value for number of token. After that click on transact, and click on totalSupply to see number of tokens minted.
Under burn section give the address and value for burning given number of tokens.After that click on transact, and click on totalSupply to see number of tokens burned.
